        Muhammad Kilau bin Rasu (Jawi: محمد كيلاو بن راسو; 1866/67 – 16 August 1970) popularly known as 'Mat Kilau', or alternatively known as Mohamed bin Ibrahim or 'Mat Siam', was a local chieftain and folk hero from Pahang, Malaysia, best known for his role in the Pahang Uprising (1891–1895) against the British Empire. The outbreak of the resistance movement in Pahang in the late 19th century was mainly fueled by the grievances among the traditional ruling class towards the British Residential system.
